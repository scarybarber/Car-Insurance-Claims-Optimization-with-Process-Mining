# 🚗 Car Insurance Claims Optimization with Process Mining 

This project simulates a consulting engagement to analyze and optimize the car insurance claims process using real-world event log data from Kaggle. It mirrors the kind of work done by Value Engineers at Celonis or Tech Advisors at firms like Accenture, Capgemini, or Adesso.

---

## 🧠 Project Objectives

- Understand and visualize the full insurance claim process
- Identify bottlenecks and rework loops
- Segment delays by resource, policy type, and accident type
- Provide strategic recommendations backed by data
- Prepare the foundation for a KPI dashboard in Power BI

---

## 🧰 Tools Used

- Python: `pandas`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`
- Power BI: for KPI dashboard and business storytelling
- Data source: [Kaggle - Insurance Claims Event Log](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carlosalvite/car-insurance-claims-event-log-for-process-mining)

## 🔍 Key Analyses

### ✅ Data Wrangling
- Parsed timestamps from MM:SS.s format into durations
- Sorted events by `case_id` and time
- Calculated `activity_duration` and total `case_duration`

### ✅ Exploratory Data Analysis
- 📦 Activity-level delay analysis (boxplots)
- 🕓 Case duration distribution (histogram)
- 🔢 Process complexity via activity count
- 🔁 Most common event sequences ("happy paths")
- 🧭 Rare and broken paths (for root cause discovery)
- 👤 Delay by agent
- 🏷️ Segment delays by:
  - `type_of_policy`
  - `type_of_accident`
  - `car_year`

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard (Phase 3)
Exported clean datasets for use in Power BI:
- `cleaned_event_log.csv`: activity-level data
- `case_summary.csv`: case-level metrics

> Visualizations include:
> - KPI cards (avg duration, max delay)
> - Donut charts (claim types)
> - Bar plots (delay by agent/type)
> - Sankey or Gantt views of process flows

## 🧾 File Structure


## 📈 Sample Insights

- Claims with rollover accidents take ~40% longer on average
- Some agents consistently contribute to delays above the mean
- Claims on older vehicles show higher variability in resolution time
- "Fast lane" patterns suggest room for triage-based routing

## 💼 Business Value

> A 25% reduction in average case duration could lead to significant time savings and increased customer satisfaction — insights like these drive real impact in enterprise process mining.
